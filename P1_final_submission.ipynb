    "***\n",
    "In this project, you will use the tools you learned about in the lesson to identify lane lines on the road.  You can develop your pipeline on a series of individual images, and later apply the result to a video stream (really just a series of images). Check out the video clip \"raw-lines-example.mp4\" (also contained in this repository) to see what the output should look like after using the helper functions below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a result that looks roughly like \"raw-lines-example.mp4\", you'll need to get creative and try to average and/or extrapolate the line segments you've detected to map out the full extent of the lane lines.  You can see an example of the result you're going for in the video \"P1_example.mp4\".  Ultimately, you would like to draw just one line for the left side of the lane, and one for the right.\n",

    "I learned that removing noise and smoothing the image si really important when applying image processing algorithms. I developed an algorithm that averages the slopes and ignores outliers, with odd values relative to the ones we're searching for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since it is expected that the location and direction of the lines in successive frames shouldn't change a lot, I am averaging the lines information in time as well. This helps to stabilize the lines so changes in location are more continuous. About a second of video is averaged in the final version. In the optional challenge this helps improv since the 'empty' zone is relatively large, the algorithm eventually loses track of the lines(but it is also quick to get back on track).\n",

I believe [2] is very closely related to what I worked on but the concept of Hyperbola fitting is something that intrigued me. [3] is interesting but I would not like to spend a lot of time on it.\n",
